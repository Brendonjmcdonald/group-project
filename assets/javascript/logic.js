// Connect to API's (and database if using)

// Get data from API's for when the page initially loads and place them 
	// in their respective divs using jQuery

// Create on click function for when each drop down is clicked (may switch to submit button)
// When an option in the dropdown is clicked the results change based on
	// user selects

	// Examples of results:
		// Avg house price
		// Avg rent price
		// Avg salary for job selected
		// Current weather
		// Picture of the city or location
		// Short description of the location and what it is know for

// The results are listed from 1-10 based on best match to user's selections
// We only get 10 results

// Within the results are other on click functions that will take the user
	// to the respective website where the API data is being pulled
		// Example: when the user clicks the current weather it takes them
		// to the weather channel page of that location, so that the user can
		// see more data than we are showing.
